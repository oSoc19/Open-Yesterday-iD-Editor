## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 6 or newer
* [`git`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git/) for your platform
  * Note for Windows users:
    * Edit `$HOME\.gitconfig`:<br/>
      Add these lines to avoid checking in files with CRLF newlines<br><pre>
      [core]
          autocrlf = input</pre>

## Installation

Note: Windows users should run these steps in a shell started with "Run as administrator".
This is only necessary the first time so that the build process can create symbolic links.

To run the current development version of iD on your own computer:

#### Cloning the repository

The repository is reasonably large, and it's unlikely that you need the full history (~200 MB). If you are happy to wait for it all to download, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/oSoc19/Open-Yesterday-iD-Editor.git
```

To clone only the most recent version, instead use a 'shallow clone':

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/oSoc19/Open-Yesterday-iD-Editor.git
```

If you want to add in the full history later on, perhaps to run `git blame` or `git log`, run `git fetch --depth=1000000`

#### Building iD

1. `cd` into the newly cloned project folder
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run all`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:8080/` in a web browser
